Note that for the purpose of preparing the Balance Sheet at the end of each year: For investments, you need to classify whether they are current assets (i.e., short-term investment) or non-current assets (i.e., long-term investment); For bonds, you need to determine what portion of the bonds payable is current liability and what portion is non-current liability. Current portion of the bonds payable is the principal payment portion of the cash interest payments in the next year. Non-current portion is the remaining amount of the bonds payable; and For leases (as the lessee), you need to determine what portion of the lease obligation is current liability and what portion is non-current liability. Current portion of the lease obligation is the principal payment portion of the cash lease payment in the next year (i.e., the amortization amount of the lease obligation in the next year). Non-current portion is the remaining amount of the lease liability. Project 3.1 Balance Sheet Illini Company, Inc.
